# OpenCV Face and Eye Detection



This Python script leverages the power of OpenCV to perform real-time face and eye detection in video streams. It captures video from the camera and highlights detected faces and eyes with rectangles, providing a visual representation of the detection process.

## Introduction

Modern computer vision techniques like face and eye detection have a wide range of applications, from biometrics to augmented reality. This project demonstrates a simple implementation of real-time face and eye detection using Haar Cascade classifiers provided by OpenCV. The script is designed for educational purposes and can serve as a starting point for more complex computer vision projects.

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/123456Arshia/face_detector
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   Install the required dependency, OpenCV, using pip:

   ```sh
   pip install opencv-python
   ```

3. **Run the Script:**

   Navigate to the project directory and run the script:

   ```sh
   python face_eye_detection.py
   ```

4. **Exit the Application:**

   Press 'q' to exit the application.

## Features

- **Face and Eye Detection:** Utilizes Haar Cascade classifiers to detect faces and eyes in real-time video streams.
- **Visual Feedback:** Draws rectangles around detected faces and eyes, providing a visual representation of the detection process.
- **Simple Code Structure:** The script has been organized into functions for ease of understanding and further development.
